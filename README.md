# Project Motivation
Online services are the main means of selling goods over the internet for most of companies nowadays. It is crucial to find out which individuals are most likely to become customers for a company. Distinguishing the right customers to sell products allows the company to reach only those potential customers and greatly save resources. In this project, I will do an exploratory data analysis on demographics data for customers of a mail-order company in Germany and answer the following questions:

Which part of population is going to be the targets of the marketing campaign for the company?
Which individuals are most likely to be customers of the company?
